<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney (USYD), advised by Prof. Chang Xu. I obtained my Ph.D. degree at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University (WHU) in June 2024, under the supervision of Prof. Bo Du and Prof. Chang Xu. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science from Wuhan University in June 2019. I was a visiting research student at the University of Sydney (USYD) from 2022 to 2023.

My research interests lie in reinforcement learning/imitation learning algorithms and their applications in robotics. In addition, I closely follow the latest developments in generative models and LLMs.

📢 Feel free to reach out if you are seeking research collaboration in the field of robotics🤖/generative models🎨/VLM🧠.
