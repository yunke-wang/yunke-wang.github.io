Yunke Wang currently is pursuing his Ph.D. degree in the School of Computer Science at Wuhan University (WHU), co-advised by Prof. [Bo Du](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2892.htm) and Dr. [Chang Xu](http://changxu.xyz). Before that, he received his B.S. degree in computer science from Wuhan University in 2019. He is a visiting researcher at the university of Sydney (USYD) since September 2022.

His research interest lies in Imitation Learning and its applications in computer vision fields. Specifically, he wants to make imitation learning more practical in real-world tasks by considering how to exploit imperfect demonstrations. He also keeps a close attention on deep learning algorithms in computer vision.
