Yunke Wang is currently pursuing his Ph.D. degree at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University (WHU), co-advised by Prof. [Bo Du](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2892.htm) and Dr. [Chang Xu](http://changxu.xyz). Before that, he received his B.S. degree in computer science from Wuhan University in 2019. He is a visiting researcher at the University of Sydney (USYD) since September 2022.

His research interests lie in imitation learning and its applications in computer vision fields. Specifically, he wants to make imitation learning more practical in real-world tasks by exploring how to leverage imperfect and visual demonstrations effectively. In addition, he closely follows the latest developments in generative models within the computer vision field.
